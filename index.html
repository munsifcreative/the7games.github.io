Your character can only carry around a limited amount of gear, so there are important questions to ask whenever you come across new items. Is it better to stick with your current 9mm pistol, or hold out hope that you'll be able to find ammo for a found 12 gauge shotgun?"<br> <br> PUBG Mobile is running on Unreal Engine 4, players take on the Battle Royale experience on a map called "Erangel." </p> <br> <h2>#6-Shadow Fight 3</h2> <p><strong>CATEGORY :</strong> ROLE PLAYING<br> <strong>RATING :</strong> 4.4</p> <img src="5.jpg" alt="SHADOW FIGHT 3" style="width:560px;height:315px"> <br> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xhGNIySaqwg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen> </iframe> <br> <form> <p align="left"> <input type="button" value="Download From Playstore" onclick="window.location.href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nekki.shadowfight3&hl=en'" button class="button" /> </p> </form> <form> <p align="left"> <input type="button" value="Download From AppStore" onclick="window.location.href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shadow-fight-3/id964827011?mt=8'" button class="apple" /> </p> </form> <h4>ABOUT THE GAME</h4> <p>Shadow Fight 3 is a action-RPG fighting game developed by Nekki.

It was released on iOS and Android on 28 February 2013 under the freemium business model; it was free to download, with enhancements available through in-app purchases. The game is the sequel to 2009's Real Racing and 2010's Real Racing 2. Primarily due to the freemium nature of the game, it received less favorable reviews than its predecessors, although the gameplay remains generally lauded.[4]<br> <br> Game features include 19 real-world racetracks, a 22-car grid, and 209 officially licensed cars from 33 manufacturers such as Audi, Porsche, Lamborghini, Bugatti, Ford, Ferrari, McLaren and Koenigsegg. Unlike in the previous Real Racing games, players are required to maintain and service their vehicles, requiring in-game cash and real-world time. <h6>Gameplay</h6> <p>When players begin the game, they are lent a Porsche 911 GT3 RS as a tutorial car, going through the basic tutorial of the game. They then must buy a Nissan Silvia S15 or a Ford Focus RS as a starting car. The player begins the game at driver level 0 and increases his/her rank as he/she earns "fame points" (similar to experience) based on his/her performance in a race. Once they pass driver levels, gold coins are rewarded at each level up. Depending upon the amount of fame points required to reach the new level, the game rewards from 5 to 100 coins of the premium currency. The game as a whole is divided into multiple different series, each series is further subdivided into several tiers, and each tier into one to three individual races.<br> <br> Series: There are a total of 135 series in the game as of June 2017, and only certain cars can be used in any given series (most series allow the use of 3-5 cars, although some only allow one car, or up to 13). When the game was first released, a series became available for play immediately when the player has purchased one of the cars usable in that series. However, as of update 1.2 (July 2013), a series must be unlocked by winning a certain number of trophies in a previous series. Any car that is allowed in a given series can be used in any race within that series, with exception of "showcase" races, where only one specific car may be used. This means most series cannot be completed to 100% unless the player has purchased all usable cars for that series, although the vast majority of cars can be used in more than one series. Upon finishing 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of a series, R$ and gold are awarded to the player. To achieve 100% completion of a series, the player must earn a gold trophy (first place for races and complete one or more Time Trial event's without going off-track or colliding into any barriers) in each event of the series. Tiers: Every series is divided into about seventeen to twenty two tiers, all of which contain one to three races. Upon entering a particular series, only one tier is available, although once a tier is unlocked all races within that tier are available for play. More tiers are unlocked as the player earns bronze, silver and gold medals in the races of a previous tier, or can be unlocked by use of in-game currency or gold coins.<br> Unlike in the previous Real Racing games, players are required to maintain and service their vehicles; if the player does not perform such maintenance, the car's performance will suffer drastically. Performing maintenance and upgrades requires in-game cash and also takes up real-world time, often up to several hours, depending on the car being serviced.<br> <br> There are two types of currency in the game: "Race dollars" (referred to as "R$") and gold. R$ is earned by completing races, advancing in a series, completing laps without leaving the track or bumping into other cars, and hiring the Manager. Gold coins are earned only by finishing each quarter of a series, advancing to a higher driver level, completing Game Center/Google Play Games achievements (as of update 2.1), by watching fifteen to thirty second advertisements available in-game, opening the application every day, or by completing partner offers. R$ can be used to purchase new cars, buy upgrades, and pay for maintenance. Gold coins are used to immediately finish maintenance, deliver newly purchased cars without waiting, unlock new tiers, instantly unlock cars, buy higher level upgrades, customize cars, and purchase cars that are not available through R$. The player can purchase both R$ and gold coins with real-world money in the in-app store if they wish. Upon the initial release of the game, 148Apps.com calculated that to earn enough R$ to buy every car in the game would take over 472 hours of gameplay, covering 6,801 races, at an average of 4 minutes 10 seconds per race and an average reward of R$3,700 per race. To purchase every car in the game using gold purchased with real-world money would cost $503.22. These figures did not take into account any upgrades, repairs or maintenance.[5]<br> <br> A significant component of the game is that the player must wait for maintenance and the "delivery" of newly purchased cars. From the announcement of this aspect of the game, it has been a controversial topic, although it does further reinforce the real component of the game.[6] When a player races, if they race hard, go off track, or hit other cars, their car picks up damage and becomes more in need of maintenance. Eventually, the car will deteriorate to the point that it begins to under-perform. At this stage, the player must get the car serviced, which can take up to several hours in real-time. This time can only be reduced by spending gold coins, which are much rarer in the game than R$, unless the player is willing to spend real money on them in the in-app store. This freemium nature sparked backlash from "hardcore" fans.[7] In response to negative fan feedback and bad press, in update 1.1, EA and Firemonkeys tweaked the repair times so that damage was repaired instantly whereas maintenance times became significantly shorter, although could still only be bypassed completely with the use of gold coins. As of update 1.2, repairs were removed from the game altogether, with cars now requiring maintenance only, although maintenance can still only be bypassed by gold. In update 4.0, you could watch ads to reduce maintenance or reduce upgrade times.<br> <br> Introduced in update 1.2 in July 2013, drive points are required for the player to participate in time trials. Each race costs one drive point. The player begins with two drive points, and can only increase their maximum available drive points to five by using gold coins. When the player runs out of drive points, they can use two gold coins to get a full refill or simply wait until the game automatically replenishes the points (one point is replenished every eighteen minutes).[8]<br> <br> Introduced in update 1.3.5 in September 2013, VIP service is an option available for every car in the game. Purchasing a VIP service for any car must be done through the in-app store and costs real world money, with each VIP service usable only for the car for which it is purchased. The VIP service removes any waiting times for newly purchased cars or upgrades purchased with R$. Usually, when a player purchases a new car through R$, they must wait several hours for that car to be 'delivered'. However, if they purchase the VIP service for that car, it will be delivered instantly upon purchase. The service works the same for upgrades. Any upgrades purchased with R$ take time to complete, however, if the player has purchased the VIP service, upgrades are performed instantly.[9]<br> <br> Introduced in update 1.4.0 in October 2013, crew members can be hired prior to each race. The player has the option to hire a Manager to earn double R$ if he/she places first, an Agent to earn double fame if he/she places first, and/or an Auto Engineer to maintain the condition of the car if he/she places first. The player is free to hire no crew members if they wish, or all three. Each crew member costs one gold coin. From time to time, crew members offer their services for free.<br> <p>Share Your Comments And Thoughts Below :</p> <form action="/action_page.php" id="usrform"> Name: <input type="text" name="usrname"> <input type="submit"> </form> <br> <textarea rows="4" cols="50" name="comment" form="usrform"> Type Here</textarea> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> </body> </html>
